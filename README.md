# Townsmen game clone
The idea was to make game like Townsmen 4 for old mobile phone devices. 
But in sum I made simple game, where you can build house. This house produces workers, that gather wood.
  
This game is course work project on discipline "Software architecture and Pattern design". 
Original task was to develop system and implement at least 15 patterns in one project.
I implement for about 18 patterns.

# How to play?
- Enter - choose option
- Space - build menu
- Backspace - return to previous state
- Escape - close game
